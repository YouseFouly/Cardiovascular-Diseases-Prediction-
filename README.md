# 🚀 Multi-XGBoost Model Deployment with FastAPI

This project involves building and deploying four separate XGBoost machine learning models, each trained for a unique prediction task. After training, each model is served through an API using FastAPI, allowing easy integration with front-end applications or other systems.

## 🔍 Project Overview

✅ 4 Prediction Tasks: Each model was built independently using XGBoost.

✅ Preprocessing: Each dataset was cleaned and prepared accordingly.

✅ Model Training: R squared error & mean absolute error evaluations were performed.

✅ Model Saving: Trained models were saved using pickle.

✅ API Development: A FastAPI app was created with 4 endpoints, one for each prediction model.
